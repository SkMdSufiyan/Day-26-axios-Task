# Day-26-axios-Task
Admin dashboard using axios.   
axios is used in "DataProvider.js" file.   
Kindly check "App.js", "DataContext.js", "DataProvider.js", "Dashboard.js", "Students.js", "Teachers.js", "ActionStudent.js", "ActionTeacher.js", "App.css" files to verify the code.
All the CRUD operations for both students and teachers are implemented using Context-API.
As one-to-many assignment is not possible for students-to-teachers, assigning a teacher should be done for each student individually.
The students who selected a particular teacher will be reflected in the students list of that teacher (will be reflected in teachers-list page).
So, when it is required to assign some students for a particular teacher, go to "Students List" and edit the data of those students (select that particular teacher for those students).

Kindly DO NOT REFRESH the netlify deployed site of this task when you are in the page other than home (dashboard) page.
If you refresh on page other than home page, then it will give "page not found" (problem with netlify deployment).
